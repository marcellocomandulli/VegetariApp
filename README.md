# VEGETARIAPP

[Try it here](https://vegetariapp.netlify.app/)

## THE PROJECT

This is an app designed and built for vegetarian people or who want to have a different meal.

API that I used comes from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs). It is very complete and useful for creating any app that deals with recipes.

## HOW TO USE

On the Home page there is a search bar where you can type in your recipe, which you will find below after a moment.

Nel footer trovi le nostre sezioni contatti e about us, oltre ai nostri socials.
